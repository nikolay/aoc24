# My solutions to advent of code 2024 in Haskell

I'm using this to learn Haskell, so please excuse my horrible code.

## Usage

Because I can't get a proper Haskell build tool to work, I have a simple script that will build and run the executable.

```sh
./run.sh -d <day> -p <part>
```

input goes into `./input` with the file name being the day number. (e.g. `./input/1.txt`)
